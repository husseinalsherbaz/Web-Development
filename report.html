            My experience with making this website has been very intuitive and challenging. it has given me a lot of view skills that will help me progressed smoothly into the next parts of this module. I am glad to have run through this experience because I feel like it will be very important information to understand do well in this module and in the real world of work.

            When I first started this website, I had almost no clue called what expected of me. I did not know how to create pages, use tags or even change the font size of the text. I looked back at the lectures and use them to help me create this website and make it what it is now. I also used YouTube videos and websites to help me learn different skills helping me create this website.  Over time I had progressed a lot and was able to become more independent. Most of the time it was very frustrating, and it was really humbling but sometimes it was very satisfying when the website coming together, and the code worked. I feel that the satisfying times were what kept me motivated to completing this website.

        <p> I have found that asking people for help with my work, but I will not experience things whether it would be a classmate or one of my family members was greatly helpful and valuable. I think this is because I could ask them questions quickly and get an answer which is much faster than searching for it online. However, sometimes they would not know so searching online would be my alternative option. I did the research for tasks that would require a lot of help. One example is the navigation bar. I used a YouTube video mainly for that as well as the lectures with my tutor Tom Butler. I made my own little changes to make it my own such as change the colour, font size. This had taught me a lot and it was a good start for me that helped me move on to the next part of the website. It had also taught me the hover feature which helped make the website a lot more professional looking. </p>
        <p> I have tried to make the website responsive and I have kept a close eye on the mobile view wall creating a website to see how it would look like for mobile user. It seems to need work for the CV and Report pages. The navigation bar seems to be a lot smaller in the mobile view on these pages and I am not sure why.</p>
